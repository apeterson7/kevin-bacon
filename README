An unweighted graph of actors and films implemented using a hashmap to associate strings with a list of associated strings (the edges) and a hashmap
to associate each string with a vertex object in memory.  Vertexes have a boolean class member 'isActor' to distinguish between them.

BaconNumber works best with Top250.txt but with larger files can take very long amounts of time to finish.  However, all methods do work correctly.
